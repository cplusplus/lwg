# A workflow to check generating the HTML lists works.
# The pages generated by this will have incorrect "Last modified" dates
# for the issues, because there is no meta-date/dates file used here.
# That's OK, because this is just a quick check to ensure that the XML
# is well-formed and the lists can be generated, suitable for checking
# pull requests are OK to merge.
